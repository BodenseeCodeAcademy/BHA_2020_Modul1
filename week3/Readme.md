This week we are going to try to understand java basic variable types.

Variables are basicly memory addresses which point desired type of data.

Their data can change during the program run. 

Primitive Types are :
byte
short
int 
long

float
double

boolean

For "char" data type Java uses UNICODE charset. https://unicode-table.com/en/

Another important type is : 
String 
(toUpperCase...)
(subString)
